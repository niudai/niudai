# Hello, I'm Sheldon Niu! 👋

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I am a graduate of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China. Formerly, I was a web infrastructure engineer at ByteDance. Currently, I am working at [AirCode](https://aircode.io/), committed to the construction of the next Node.js development platform, aiming to make R&D simpler and more efficient.

In addition to my work at AirCode, I am also developing an independent project, [Raber](https://www.raber.app/). The goal of Raber is to free frontend engineers from the pain of CSS and to allow non-developers to participate directly in professional frontend development, unblocking the web development workflow from frontend engineers.

Apart from my work, I am also an active content creator. I have over 70,000 followers on my [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/niu-dai-68-44). In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and engaging in arranging music, and I have some understanding of music theory and composition software.

If you are interested in what I do and would like to get in touch, feel free to reach out through email.
