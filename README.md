# Hello, I'm Sheldon Niu! 👋

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a graduate of the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). Formerly a web infrastructure engineer at ByteDance, I'm currently at [AirCode](https://aircode.io/), contributing to the construction of an advanced Node.js development platform. 

In addition, I'm the creator of [Raber](https://www.raber.app/), a project aiming to simplify web development and democratize the creation of professional frontends.

I also share my insights and interact with over 70,000 followers on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/niu-dai-68-44).

In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar and exploring music arrangement and theory.
